# health_connect_app
 The Health Tracker App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users monitor their health metrics, including diet, exercise, and menstrual cycle tracking. The app integrates with the Google Health Connect API to provide users with real-time health data and insights, promoting a healthier lifestyle.
Dependencies
flutter: The core Flutter SDK for building the app.
http: Used for making HTTP requests to the Google Health Connect API.
provider: A state management solution to manage the app's state efficiently.
Features
User-friendly interface for tracking health metrics.
Integration with Google Health Connect API for real-time data.
Ability to log daily meals, exercise, and menstrual cycle.
Visual representation of health data through charts and graphs.
Notifications and reminders for health-related activities.
Challenges
API Integration: One of the main challenges was integrating the Google Health Connect API. I overcame this by thoroughly reading the API documentation and using Postman to test API endpoints before implementing them in the app.
State Management: Managing the state of the application was initially complex. I resolved this by using the Provider package, which simplified state management and improved the app's performance.
Future Enhancements
Implement user authentication to allow personalized experiences.
Add more health metrics such as sleep tracking and hydration levels.
Enhance the UI/UX based on user feedback for better usability.
Include a community feature for users to share their health journeys and tips.
